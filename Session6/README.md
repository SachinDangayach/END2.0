# Objective

We aim to build a network that would:

1. Take the last code  (+tweet dataset) and convert that in such a war that:
  - encoder: an RNN/LSTM layer takes the words in a sentence one by one and finally converts them into a single vector. VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THIS SINGLE VECTOR
    this single vector is then sent to another RNN/LSTM that also takes the last prediction as its second input. Then we take the final vector from this Cell
    and send this final vector to a Linear Layer and make the final prediction.
  - This is how it will look:

    - embedding
    - word from a sentence +last hidden vector -> encoder -> single vector
    - single vector + last hidden vector -> decoder -> single vector
    - single vector -> FC layer -> Prediction

  - Your code will be checked for plagiarism, and if we find that you have copied from the internet, then -100%.
  - The code needs to look as simple as possible, the focus is on making encoder/decoder classes and how to link objects together
  - Getting good accuracy is NOT the target, but must achieve at least 45% or more
  - Once the model is trained, take one sentence, "print the outputs" of the encoder for each step and "print the outputs" for each step of the decoder. ‚Üê THIS IS THE ACTUAL ASSIGNMENT
