# Objective

- Follow the similar strategy as we did in our baby-steps-code (Links to an external site.), but replace GRU with LSTM. In your code you must:
- Perform 1 full feed forward step for the encoder manually
- Perform 1 full feed forward step for the decoder manually.
- You can use any of the 3 attention mechanisms that we discussed.

# Solution -

## Feed forward steps for encoder


## Feed forward steps for decoder


## Attention Mechanism
